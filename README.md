Project Title: Social Network Analysis Tool

Project Description:
The Social Network Analysis Tool is a Java program that enables users to create and analyze a basic social network. Users can add individuals as users and establish connections (friendships) between them. Additionally, the tool allows users to find mutual friends between any two individuals within the social network.

Features:

Add User: Users can add individuals to the social network by providing their names.

Add Connection: Users can create connections (friendships) between two individuals within the network.

Find Mutual Friends: The application enables users to find mutual friends between any two individuals by entering their names. It displays a list of common friends.

Quit: The program can be terminated gracefully by choosing the "Quit" option.

How to Use:

Compile and run the SocialNetworkAnalysis.java file using a Java development environment or command line.

Follow the on-screen instructions to perform actions within the social network analysis tool.

Usage Examples:

Add User: Enter the name of an individual to add them to the social network.
Add Connection: Specify the names of two individuals to establish a connection (friendship) between them.
Find Mutual Friends: Enter the names of two individuals to discover their mutual friends within the network.
Quit: Exit the social network analysis tool.
This project serves as a basic introduction to social network analysis and graph theory concepts. It demonstrates how to use the JGraphT library for graph representation and manipulation. Users can extend this project by adding more advanced features, such as calculating degrees of separation, visualizing the social network graph, and saving/loading network data.

Feel free to enhance the project's documentation, improve user interface feedback and add error handling for a more robust user experience.
